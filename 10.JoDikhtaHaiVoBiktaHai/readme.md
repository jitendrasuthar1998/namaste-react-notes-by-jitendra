#### There are lot of ways we can add CSS in our React application.

1. Normal CSS
2. Styled Component
3. Material UI
4. Bootstrap
5. Tailwind CSS


PostCSS is a tool to transform CSS using JavaScript.

Parecel will use PostCSS to read Tailwind CSS.

Tailwind is a very lightweight css library.

Tailwind gives you predefined css styles which you can use in your code.


It only includes code of the css classes that we use once or many times in our code.

If we have used p-4 class at many places, that time it will only code of p-4 class only one time when we bundle our code.
